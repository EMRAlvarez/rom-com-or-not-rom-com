"And then, suddenly, it's the weekend, and from break of day hundreds of stalls appear out of nowhere, filling Portobello Road, right up to Notting Hill Gate. And wherever you look thousands of people are buying millions of antiques, some genuine and some... not quite so genuine. And what's great is that lots of friends have ended up in this part of London. That's Tony, for example, architect turned chef, who recently invested all the money he ever earned in a new restaurant. And so, this is where I spend my days and years... in this small village in the middle of the city in a house with a blue door... that my wife and I bought together before she left me for a man... who looked exactly like Harrison Ford. And where I lead a strange half-life with a lodger called-- Spike! You couldn't help me with an incredible important decision, could you? Is this important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel Third World debt? That's right. I am at last going out on a date with the great Janine, and I just wanna be sure I've picked the right T-shirt. - What are the choices? - Well, wait for it. First there's this one. Cool, huh? Yeah, it might make it hard to strike a really romantic note. Point taken. Don't despair. If it's romance we're looking for, I believe I have just the thing. Yeah, well, there again, she might not think you had true love on your mind. Right. Just one more. True love here I come. Well, yeah. Yeah, that's-- that's, um, perfect. Great. Thanks. - Wish me luck. - Good luck. And so it was just another hopeless Wednesday, as I walked the thousand yards through the market to work, never suspecting that this was the day that was gonna change my life forever. This is work, by the way, my little travel bookshop."
