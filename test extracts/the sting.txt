"Don't let him get away! He's got my wallet! He's got all my money! My wallet! He's got my wallet! We got it! What happened? Did he get you with the knife? You need a doctor. I'll call a cop. No, no! No cops! You wanted by the law? No, it's okay. Are you nuts, carrying a wad like that in this neighborhood? Thanks. I'm obliged to you.I've got to get going.You ain't going nowhere on this leg.I've got to. Got to run some slots in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind in the payoffs. They think I've been holding out on them. They gave me until 4:00 to come up with the cash. If they don't get it, I'm dead. It don't look good, Gramps. It's almost 4:00 now. I'll give you and your friend $100 to deliver it for me. I don't know. The mug that hit you is mad at me. What if he's waiting around the corner? He won't know you're carrying it. You've got to help me. I'm sorry. I'll help you get to a doctor, but I ain't about to walk into no knife for you"
