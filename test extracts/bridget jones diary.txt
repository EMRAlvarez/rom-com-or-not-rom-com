I was in London at a party last night so I'm afraid I'm a bit hung over. Wish I could be lying with my head in the toilet. Like all normal people. New Year's resolution drink less. Oh, and quit smoking. Mmm. Ha. Oh. Oh. Ha. And keep New Year's resolutions. Oh. And, uh. stop talking total nonsense to strangers. In fact, stop talking, full stop. Yes, well, perhaps it's time to eat. Mmm. Apparently. she lives just 'round the corner from you. Mother, I do not need a blind date. 
Particularly not with some verbally incontinent spinster who smokes like a chimney, drinks like a fish and dresses like her mother. Yummy. Turkey curry. My favourite. And that was it. Right there. Right there. That was the moment. I suddenly realized that unless some thing changed soon I was going to live a life
where my major relationship was with a bottle of wine. I'd finally die fat and alone"
