"We don't have food. We don't have water. We don't even have a radio. Stephen you need to get some sleep. What the hell is it? Looks like a... shopping center. One of those big indoor lots. Oh my God! No chance. Forget it. Let's get out of here! Wait a minute. They can't get up here. Yeah, we can't go down there! Let's check it out. Most of the gates are down. I don't think they can get into the stores. I haven't seen any of then up on the second floor. The big departments stores usually use both floors. If we can ge it up top... Ok. Guess the power's not off in this area. Could be nuclear. What are they doing? Why do they come here? Some kind of instinct. Memory... Of what they used to do. This was an important place in their lives. Hey... Look at this! These don't go down to the mall. What the hell is this? How do we get down there? Ok, c'mon Fran, let go. Well, it's done. Looks like a free lunch. Spam! Do you bring a can opener? No, I guess I didn't. Then don't knock it. It got it's own key. What do you think? This is the only way up here. What do you think? You better get some sleep too, buddy.There's an awful lot of stuff down there that we could use."
